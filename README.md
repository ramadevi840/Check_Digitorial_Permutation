# Check_Digitorial_Permutation
You are given an integer n.  A number is called digitorial if the sum of the factorials of its digits is equal to the number itself.  Determine whether any permutation of n (including the original order) forms a digitorial number.
Return true if such a permutation exists, otherwise return false.

Note:

The factorial of a non-negative integer x, denoted as x!, is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to x, and 0! = 1.
A permutation is a rearrangement of all the digits of a number that does not start with zero. Any arrangement starting with zero is invalid.
 

Example 1:

Input: n = 145

Output: true

Explanation:

The number 145 itself is digitorial since 1! + 4! + 5! = 1 + 24 + 120 = 145. Thus, the answer is true.

Example 2:

Input: n = 10

Output: false

Explanation:​​​​​​​

10 is not digitorial since 1! + 0! = 2 is not equal to 10, and the permutation "01" is invalid because it starts with zero.
